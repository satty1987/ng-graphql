        <h1>A query language for your API</h1>
        <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL
          provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for
          exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful
          developer&nbsp;tools.</p>
